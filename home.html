          <h1>Hey Basecamp,</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          I’m Courtney. I solve problems with design and code. I'd like to do that at Basecamp. 
        </p>

      <div class="about me">
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a curious, thoughtful, and passionate Product Designer. I’ve also been a Front-End Developer. Past work includes fitness, e-commerce, and tech, with a dash of <a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/print-design" target="_blank">print design</a> just for fun. I like working on projects that make the world a better place. I can check off the boxes for all the hard-skills on your list:

          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <p>
            Currently I’m at <a href="https://recollect.net" target="_blank">ReCollect</a>, where I’m a product design <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank">manager of one</a>.

              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I advocate for design improvements in the product roadmap.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I collaborate with Software Developers and Product Managers to come up with designs that are technically feasible and elegant, and solve real customer problems.</li>

            </ul>
            Some projects I've worked on in the past year include:

            </ul>
          </p> 
          <h3>Previously</h3>   
          <p>
            I've been in the tech industry sincd 2011. Prior to ReCollect I spent 5 years as a front-end developer at <a href="https://dailyburn.com" target="_blank">Daily Burn</a>. Before that, I worked in UX Design at a large agency in NYC, and prior to that I attended NYU’s <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a> where I designed and prototyped this <a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/gluteolicious" target="_blank">virtual spin bike</a>. Some might say it was the original Peloton. Before all that, I taught spin classes in NYC. I studied math and biology in undergrad.

        <h3>Why Basecamp?</h3>
          <p>
            Ever since reading <em>Shape Up</em> last year, I’ve wanted to work for Basecamp. I've never really used your product, so I’m not a diehard Basecamp, the product fan (yet). I <em>am</em> a big fan of Basecamp, the company. I don’t think there is one “right” process in product development, but I do know there are lots of bad ones. I love that you have a system, and that you’ve nailed it down so well you wrote a book on it! 
          </p>
          <p>
            I admire your straightforward approach to management, compensation, and communication. You seem to care just as much about <em>how</em> you work as you do about what you build, and I think that’s really cool. It's clear you know a thing or two about design. (My tired eyes appreciated the large font size you chose for your employee handbook as I was reading it late at night.) I think I could learn a lot from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at your team and thought - <em>“there’s not a lot of diversity here, I wonder if I should even apply.”</em> But, you also called yourselves out on that lack of diversity, which shows integrity. That's the kind of company and people I want to work with.
          </p>
          <h3>Where I Want To Go</h3>
          <p>
            I want to take the best of everything I’ve ever done in my career and combine it all to do my best work yet, at Basecamp. I want to create great products with great people. In ten years, I'd like to rise through the ranks from Senior Designer to Principle. I've taught yoga and CrossFit in the past, and I'd like to apply those leadership and mentoring skills to my design career without having to give up working on real projects. I want to <em>learn</em> new skills and share what I know. I want to grow personally and professionally, and I want to do it at Basecamp!
          </p>
          <h3>Why Me?</h3>
          <p>
            I love a challenge. I go above and beyond. People like working with me. I share your values. I respect and admire your people and your work, and I know we could do great work together.
          </p>
          <h3>I’m Remote</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve spent the majority of my career working remotely. First as one of only a handful of remote employees for a primarily co-located company, <a href="https://dailyburn.com" target="_blank">Daily Burn</a>, and now at a fully distributed company. I get it. I love it. I'm great at it. I love my work. I strive for greatness in my career. I don't live to work; I work to live, and remote is the best environment for me to do that.

        <p>
          I have a wife and a 2-year old son, so working from home allows me to cook, clean, and do more laundry throughout the day! I’m a morning person. If I’m lucky enough to be the only one up, I use that time for yoga (my favourite teacher is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marcoyoga/" target="_blank">@marcoyoga</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-Covid I was an avid <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eSSnUBpBW/" target="_blank">CrossFitter</a>, but have since switched to <a href="https://streetparking.com/" target="_blank">Street Parking</a> home workouts. On weekends you might find me and my family at the local pumpkin patch or berry farm, hitting the beach, or hiking local trails.

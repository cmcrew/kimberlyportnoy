          <h1>Hey Basecamp,</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Do you have a CrossFitting, yoga practicing, (decaf) espresso drinking, ice cream loving, toddler wrangling designer on your team yet? You should!
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m Courtney. I spend my days designing for <a href="https://recollect.net" target="_blank">ReCollect</a>, working out, and chasing a toddler. I feel like I was made for this role. Like all the weird twists and turns of my career were leading me to Basecamp.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about me">
          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <p>
            Currently I am the one and only product designer at ReCollect. As a team (or manager) of one, I am a self-directed leader who gets sh*t done.
            <ul class="fa-ul">
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I lead all design-based projects at ReCollect.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I advocate for design improvements in the product roadmap.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I collaborate with Software Developers and Product Managers to come up with designs that are technically feasible and elegant, and solve real customer problems.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>I perform regular user testing so that design decisions can be evidence based.</li>
            </ul>
            Some projects I've worked on in the past year include:
            <ul class="fa-ul">
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span><a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/recollect-waste-wizard" target="_blank">Designing new tools</a> to allow users to bulk edit data, drastically reducing the amount of time it takes to accomplish a task.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span><a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/recollect-campaign-templates" target="_blank">Implementing a categorization scheme</a> for customer campaign templates, which resulted in increased adoption of the tool.</li>
              <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-minus-square"></i></span>A <a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/recollect-redesign" target="_blank">UI refresh</a> of our main products, bringing our aesthetic up to modern standards while improving usability. (still in progress)</li>
            </ul>
          </p> 
          <h3>Previously</h3>   
          <p>
            I've been in the tech industry since 2011. Prior to ReCollect I spent 5 years as a front-end developer at <a href="https://dailyburn.com" target="_blank">Daily Burn</a>. I've also worked in UX Design at a large agency in NYC, and led a <a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/fitmapped" target="_blank">small startup</a> from concept to launch. Prior to that I attended NYU’s <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a> where I designed and prototyped this <a href="https://digitalcourtney.com/gluteolicious" target="_blank">virtual spin bike</a>. Some might say it was the original Peloton. Before all that, I taught spin classes in NYC, and before <em>that</em> (we're getting way back now), I studied Applied Math and Biology in undergrad.

        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
          <p>
            I see Basecamp as my next big move. The place I stay for… who knows, maybe forever? I don’t like job hopping much. I want a great company with great people, great ideas, and great benefits, without all the politics and layers of red-tape that come with larger organizations. Basecamp is that company. I've wanted to work for you ever since reading <em>Shape Up</em> last year. You <em>“put your money where your mouth is.”</em> You’re opinionated, you’re thought leaders, and people love you. You've launched a new product (hey hey!), you’re growing, and I’d like to grow with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at your team and thought - <em>“there’s not a lot of diversity here, I wonder if I should even apply.”</em> But, you called yourselves out it, which shows integrity and self-awareness. That's the kind of company and people I want to work with.
          </p>
          <h3>Why Me?</h3>
          <p>
            I want a role that requires me to use my entire skillset: design, code, leadership, collaboration. I want to take the best of everything I’ve ever done in my career and combine it all to do my best work yet. I'm loyal, dedicated, and humble. I love a challenge. I go above and beyond. People like working with me. I share your values. I respect and admire your people and your work, and I know we could do great work together.
          </p>
          <h3>I’m Remote</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve spent the majority of my career working remotely. First as one of only a handful of remote employees for a primarily co-located company, <a href="https://dailyburn.com" target="_blank">Daily Burn</a>, and now at a fully distributed company. I get it. I love it. I'm great at it. I love my work. I strive for greatness in my career. I don't live to work; I work to live, and remote is the best environment for me to do that.

        <p>
          I have a wife and a 2-year old son, so working from home allows me to cook, clean, and do more laundry throughout the day! I’m a morning person. If I’m lucky enough to be the only one up, I use that time for yoga (my favourite teacher is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marcoyoga/" target="_blank">@marcoyoga</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-Covid I was an avid <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eSSnUBpBW/" target="_blank">CrossFitter</a>, but have since switched to <a href="https://streetparking.com/" target="_blank">Street Parking</a> home workouts. On weekends you might find me and my family at the local pumpkin patch or berry farm, hitting the beach, or hiking local trails.
